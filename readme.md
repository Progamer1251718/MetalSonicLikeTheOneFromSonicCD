Yo so like uhh friggin

first you gotta open "config-example.json"

and rename it "config.json"

and put your token in there when you make a bot

then you gotta install node.js

then you just run  "node index.js" in the install folder using the friggin command line

and then you have your bot running

you can friggin invite it to your server and whatever

then when it's in your server

just type "!play {your song url}" in the chat

or !skip

or !stop

but only the shortened urls you get from the friggin share button on youtube work for now
so uhh yeah

here's the songs you can play
